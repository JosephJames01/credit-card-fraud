    "MLP stands for multi-layer perceptron. It is a feedforward neural network made of an input layer and one or more hidden hidden layers as well as an output layer. Each neuron takes a weighted sum of its inputs, adds a bias and passes it through a non-linear activation function. The weighting between each neuron is trained using backpropogation.\n",
    "\n",
    "Both MLP and logistic regression both compute a linear combination of inputs and pass it through a function that takes the output to a probability for the positive class. A single layer MLP with a sigmoid function is logistic regression. MLP adds many of these which creates a stack of logistic units that are better at estimating very non-linear relationships. Both Logistic regression and a MLP can be trained using gradient descent on a loss function. With MLP the gradient has to be pushed back through the multiple layers to alter the weights. Scikit-learn solvers such as adam, which will be used here, is a type of gradient descent optimiser. "
